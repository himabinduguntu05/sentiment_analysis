# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project focuses on performing **Sentiment Analysis** on textual data using **Machine Learning techniques**.  
The model classifies input text into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiments.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to identify emotions or opinions expressed in text.  
In this project, text data is preprocessed, vectorized, and analyzed using machine learning algorithms to predict sentiment accurately.
